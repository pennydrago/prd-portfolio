          <h3>My design journey</h3>
          <p>When I started this course, I had a basic idea of typeface, layout and color, and I had used style guides during my previous work as a freelance editor.</p>
          <p>By completing this course, I have a better understanding of the design process that user interface (UI) designers work through, from understanding the client brief and creating a mood board through to creating design outputs such as wireframes and prototypes. Thoughtful consideration and use of layout grids, color, typeface and icons can create user interfaces that are user-friendly and appealing. Accessibility, web responsiveness and web conventions are also important in website design. To create consistent designs, a style guide, interface inventory and a collection of design patterns are practical tools. A digital tool, such as Figma, is also important for applying this knowledge to create digital designs. Through this course I was able to learn and develop skills using Figma to create design artefacts.</p>
          <p>I feel that completing this course, including the design challenges and course tasks below, will help me in my future work as a front-end web developer and also help me in creating personal projects.</p>

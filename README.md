# Penny Drago Portfolio

## This is my portfolio website.

### Description
This portfolio website (created by using HTML and CSS) describes my background, skills and projects.

The red and grey color scheme was based on shades and tints of the hues #752327 and #8E8F89. The chosen colors passed accessibility for color contrast and color blindness (see Resources below). The sans-serif font stack (Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif) was chosen to improve accessibility.

### Technology stack

          <h3>Brand identity</h3>
          <p>Crystal Wolf is a travel company that provides customers with a range of travel packages. Their mission is to help people connect with nature and experience travel in a calm, relaxing and refreshing way. The business is based on supporting customers to embrace nature and fresh air, disconnect from technology, slow down and reset, and spend quality time with family and friends. The company's values are honesty, customer focus, trust, responsibility and respect. The business name 'Crystal Wolf' reflects these characacteristics: 'Crystal' is associated with words like 'water', 'clear' and 'transparent', and 'Wolf' is linked to words like 'bold', 'brave', 'strong', 'loyal' and 'teamwork'.</p>
          <p>The business represents modern and sleek terminology, with designs of minimal content and a color scheme of mostly black, gray and white with small elements in blue or green colors. The designs are also engaging with large photographs of landscapes.</p>
          <p>The mood board for the design solution is shown in Figure 1. It displays the designed brand logo, color palette, typeface, icons, buttons and text elements. Sample images are also included for inspiration for a potential client.</p>

          <h2>User interface design portfolio: Design challenge 2</h2>
          <p>This course design challenge was completed for the User Interface Design Foundations Online Course at Academy Xi. The goal of this design challenge was to redesign a website or app for a brand, with these requirements: select a brand and redesign their app or website to mid-high fidelity using the same logo and color palette.</p>

          <h3>Brand identity</h3>
          <p>Golden Circle is a food manufacturing company that makes a range of fruit and vegetable products. They have been established for many decades, with a strong connection to pineapple farming in Queensland Australia, and they use new initiatives to reduce environmental impacts.</p>
          <p>The <a class="link" href="https://www.goldencircle.com.au/">Golden Circle website</a> exhibits an appealing and engaging design, with bright colors and images of their products. I think the website could benefit from a slight redesign in areas such as visual hierarchy and element alignment to improve the user experience.</p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the mood board for the redesigned website. The brand logo from the website is included, as well as the color palette, sample images, icons, text elements and a call-to-action (CTA) button.</p>

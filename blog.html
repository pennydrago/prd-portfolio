          <h2>Reflection on learning JavaScript</h2>
          <p>29 April 2023</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>As part of my Front-End Web Development course with Academy Xi, I embarked on a journey of learning
            JavaScript. I found JavaScript to be a huge step-up from learning HTML (hypertext markup language) and CSS
            (cascading style sheets). While reflecting on the topics covered over the last 8 weeks, I've realised that I
            have learnt a lot about JavaScript foundations. Understanding the building blocks such as variables, data
            types and functions provided a base for progressing onto more complex topics including array iterator
            methods, DOM (document object model) manipulation and communication with servers. The combination of these
            skills enabled me to build an MVP (minimum viable product) of a single-page web application for my
            JavaScript project.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Learning journey</h3>
          <p>I approached the JavaScript phase of the course with the expectation that it would be challenging. However,
            I wasn't completely prepared for the steep learning curve in a short timeframe. For the most part, I was
            able to read through the topics to keep pace with the lecture material covered each week, which was helpful
            for my understanding of the lecture content.</p>
          <p>Learning JavaScript as my first programming language has been a roller-coaster ride for me; I have been
            able to easily grasp some concepts, whereas other concepts have taken longer for me to learn. I think
            spending more time practising the skills and reading other resources would be beneficial to establish my
            understanding of concepts.</p>
          <p>Some of my key reflections from my learning journey:</p>
          <ul class="list-blog">
            <li>Persist and keep progressing through the topics.</li>
            <li>Look for other ways to learn the topic, including reading books and watching video tutorials.</li>
            <li>Practise often to cement the knowledge.</li>
            <li>Try to adopt a flexible mindset.</li>
            <li>Acknowledge that learning a programming language for the first time is challenging.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>Project</h3>
          <p>I learnt a lot from completing my JavaScript project, for which I designed and built a web application to
            search for Nobel Prizes and display the results. This was my first practical application of combining my
            knowledge of JavaScript programming, connecting to an API (application programming interface) to retrieve
            data, and manipulating the DOM to display the search results.</p>
          <p>To build my single-page web application, I started by selecting a subject and deciding on the interactivity
            for the application. I sketched wireframes and chose a background image, colour theme and font. Then I set
            up the local Git repository and remote GitHub repository for the project. After that intial set-up, I
            developed the basic HTML structure and CSS styles, including a template for the search results that would be
            displayed after user interaction with the web page. I then built the interactivity using JavaScript, testing
            during the build process and adjusting the HTML and CSS code as needed.</p>
          <p>During my project, I found that making regular commits and pushes of my code to GitHub helped me to
            separate tasks and also reminded me of my progress on the project. I managed my time by allocating blocks of
            time for both large tasks (e.g., write HTML and CSS code) and small tasks (e.g., implement JavaScript code
            for the light/dark mode functionality).</p>
          <p>Some parts of my process could have been improved. For example, it would have better to focus on getting
            the MVP working first and then spending time polishing the visual appearance. Also, I would like to further
            practise applying algorithmic problem solving in future projects.</p>
          <p>Some of my key reflections from the project:</p>
          <ul class="list-blog">
            <li>Test out code in the browser console first and then transfer the working code to the JavaScript file in
              the project.</li>
            <li>Break a functionality goal into smaller parts. Write and test small pieces of code before incorporating
              it into a bigger component.</li>
            <li>Take a break when stuck on a coding problem and come back to it later with a refreshed approach.</li>
            <li>Stay aligned with the requirements of an MVP, and keep a list of possible improvements that could be
              implemented in the future.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased with my learning journey and my JavaScript project. I'm glad that I've now developed
            the skills to create a dynamic web page.</p>
